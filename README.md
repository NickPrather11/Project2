# Project2

The second group project for UNC Bootcamp

"Dream Journal" node application utilizing Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, and Materialize demonstrating MVC design pattern and Many-to-Many sequelize associations.

Users can create an entry with associated "tags" or categories and browse entries in chronological order or by "tag". User can also toggle skins for day/night mode.

** NOTE **
For now, the login functions are inoperable. Just click outside the login modal to make it disappear.
Also, all the associations work locally, but for some reason they aren't showing on the heroku app.
Debugging currently in progress!

Heroku deployment: https://cryptic-badlands-56041.herokuapp.com/
